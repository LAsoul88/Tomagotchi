// The Tomagotchi begins with brown box on the screen and a button under that says 'open package'

// Clicking the 'open package' button will switch the box image out with the first form of our robo friend, its head. This will also begin the age timer, which will run throughout the game.

// In addition, 3 meters for Battery, Stimulation, and Modifications will appear at the top of the screen. As time passes, the battery meter will drain and the stimulation meter will fill. The modifications meter will only fill when the player adds modifications.

// 3 New buttons will also appear on the bottom of the screen for Change Batteries, Moderate Internet Usage, and Attach Parts. Respectively, these buttons will fill the battery meter, reduce the stimulation meter, and fill the modifications meter.

// Each action takes time, and only one action can be in progress at any point. The goal is to prevent the battery from draining completely, and prevent stimulation from filling completely while finding time to fill the modification meter.

// When the modification meter is full, the robot will move on to its second form. This process will continue through its third form, all the way until it reaches its fourth form. 

// If the player reaches the 4th form, they will win and the game will end. If battery drains completely or stimulation fills completely, the player loses and the game will end.
